# Example-Game
The project inside Code utilises Java which i have learnt and applied to demonstrate my understanding with this language. This code can be placed inside an environment called Processing which visually outputs code.

The above is an example of how the code would look inside Processing. 

Basic Instructions for the game:
1. The player at the bottom of the screen can move left and right using the arrow keys.
2. The player's aim is to shoot the ball so that it touches the other bouncing ball which moves horizontally from side to side.
3. The game ends if the player touches the bouncing ball and returns the number of balls launched.
